This dress is made of a cheap, thin, slinky material so the pockets wind up looking like wads of fabric sitting at your hips. It isn't cute. The material also highlights any texture on your body - which can be unflattering in the wrong light. Had to return - you can get better quality for a similar price at Target.",

   body: "The dress is a bit longer than I expected based on reviews. I bought an xl in black and l in grey purple. I really like them. I hand washed the black one and just put on a hanger to dry. I can’t soeak to how it would hold up in the washer. My theory is it looks really nice on and it’s cheap so why risk ruining it w the washer and dryer. For reference I’m 5 foot 5 and in my 9th month of pregnancy at 217 lbs. it looks really cute on but I wear a belly support under it to keep everything in around my hips etc. I’m pleased with it. I would def recommend. I only took one star off for length but for the money it’s well worth it.",

   body: "This dress is okay. It fits pretty well and is comfortable, but the material is really thin. It doesn’t really matter for the bottom as it’s flowy, but it makes the top see-through. I don’t have a large chest, and you can easily see my bra through it, so I would imagine women with large chests would have a big problem. I am keeping it because the bottom is cute, and I can throw a cardigan over the top, or wear a matte nude bra and it’s not very noticible. The sleeves are not too tight, which I sometimes have a problem with in fitted tops. I am 5’ 4” 160, and the meadium was a good length and fit other than the top being sheer.",

Washed, dryed, ironed, still fit good. Best part is after the first iron (packaging creases/wrinkles), if you get out of dryer before it stops you can pretty much get away with not ironing anymore. If you do have to iron, it is much easier. Size accurate. Colors accurate.Only negative is some of them had thick nylon attaching the tag to the back pocket, leaving somewhat noticeable holes. Bought 12 pair, this happened on three. Maybe too picky,",

I love these pants - they fit well, they're comfortable, they clean up nice, and they are perfect for business travel. But this size (44x29) is hard to find in stores. Don't know why it took me so long to realize I could order them through nordstrom, but it did. So I ordered one pair as a canary and it arrived in a couple of days and was absolutely what I was looking for. Now I'm back to order three more colors. Price is more than reasonable, too, in my opinion. Yay! No more hunting through stacks of pants at the store looking for the one pair in my size!",

Not a deal breaker, these are still one of the best pair of pants I own, and it will be tough to beat the price. When I buy another pair, however, I may try to find a slimmer pair.",

That being said, it would actually make a fantastic maternity dress if you size up - super comfy and flowy, and like I said, POCKETS! Anyway, comfy and cute and fit pretty well (Medium - 5' 6', 155#, 34C). If you have a larger chest, you might want to size up, but then it may be just a little long.

The print was a little larger and longer than the solid and thus a Medium in the print would probably work. The Large in the solid color is perfect even now at 170 lbs. If you’re larger than a C cup in the bust area I would recommend going a size up of your normal size.  The Medium should be fine for me once the baby weight is gone.",

   body: "I am unexpectedly impressed. I got off ADD medication a few months ago and then broke a rib and couldn't work out, so I have gained like 15lbs and none of my fahhhncy jeans fit me right now. I finally faced the fact that had to buy new jeans if I wanted to breathe and be sans muffin top while I get back in shape. Well...these are amazing. They fit just like designer jeans, have the perfect amount of thickness and stretch to both lift my currently flabby backside and hide my cellulite. These will fit you well if you have a bigger booty with skinny-ish legs (my legs are shaped like carrots--no thigh gap, zero calves). I would compare the fit and feel to Paige Whitley, Rag & Bone Skinny, Mother The Looker, JBrand Skinny Leg. Also, if AG Angel or Joe's Honey fit you, these might be a good skinny option. True to designer jean size.",

I am 5’ 1” and the length is PERFECT! A negative for some, I’m sure, but I’m thrilled to death because it’s so hard for me to find dresses, especially maxis. Now let’s talk about the quality - it’s amazing!! The material is soft, thick, and very flattering...it hangs perfectly. It’s not see through at all, and it has POCKETS! The quality is so much nicer than the price suggests. I will say that I also ordered the sleeveless sunflower print maxi but returned it because the color wasn’t what I was expecting. It was still adorable, just not what I was looking for. Shipping was immediate and the return process was effortless. I am THRILLED, and will be purchasing more colors!",

   body: "Most want to know the size! I am 6 feet, 175 lbs., and always wear a large, 34-35 sleeve. I ordered a Large long sleeve and the sleeves fit perfect. The rest fits a bit big, in the shoulders and body. I then ordered this short sleeve in Medium. Fit is more typical of a large, as compared side by side along all my large shirts. I included pictures and measurements because they tell the truth, I wish more reviewers would also! If sleeve length is not an issue, the medium fits best if you normally wear a large, unless you want that extra room. Being slim and trim, the medium is still more roomier than my other large shirts. Medium body is 24.5', and large is 26' wide. Length from armpit to tail, med. 15.5', large is 16'. Shoulders from seam to seam is, med. 21.5' and large 22.5' The sleeve length of a long sleeve is 33.5. on a large.",

They're skinny enough to compliment your silhouette, but not too skinny where your pants are like a second skin. I have just about every pair of 711 jeans that they offer, but this black pair is by far my favorite.Some tips to get the most out of your Levi's: for the love of God, follow the care instructions on the tag! Wash cold with like colors. Because of the dye of this particular pair, wash by itself or with other black clothes because the dye is likely to transfer. I personally recommend a laundry detergent that specializes in keeping dark clothes dark. Line dry; do not add heat at all to keep your jeans looking just like they did when they came out of the package.",

If you are more endowed, I would heavily reconsider, your sizing needs. The fabric is not too thin, or too thick. I have dressed it up, and down. The colors are very nice. I also have the long sleeved version. The only real con I can find is the dresses are VERY long. I just tied a loose knot just under one knee, and that helped to be able to walk, without tripping on the dress.

I was pretty disappointed because I'd wanted to wear it for family photos that weekend. But my bigger concern was the smell. It arrived with an overwhelming burnt smell. Strong enough to make me cough! It smells like burnt plastic. I washed it, and the good news is that it shrunk up considerably-- it now perfectly fits my short legs! The bad news is that it still reeks. I've soaked it in Febreze and washed it two more times, and the stink is still there. It worked out for photos, because people can't smell it in a picture, but unfortunately, I can't wear it because the smell is so overwhelming. I'm sure this is a fluke, but be warned!

   body: "I have been getting the random colors of the 711 skinny jean.Depending on the color and the cotton content the sizing and stretch is completely different.These are nice in the Painted Clouds color.They stretch out a little so you can get the lower of the sizes rather than the higher (if it is high in the cotton, I will always size up in these.)The paint is not really paint, it is odd, it looks like I got splattered by milk or something and only on the front. If you really want to make it look painted, then you need to add some color paint to it. Maybe I will.Anyways, the fit is good, they take about 3-4 wearings to get too stretched out to look good. The waist does stretch out a little if necessary. The pockets are small as on most women's jeans that I have tried.I had these skinny jeans, the bootleg, and the straight in the same size to try on. These fit perfect, the bootleg was too small and the straight were HUGE. So you might need to vary your sizing if you are coming from those styles in Levi's.I really like them.",

The dress’s length is also perfect in that it sits on top of my feet but isnt long enough that I trip - I don’t like my ankles showing so this is a good length for me. Ladies who are shorter - this dress is VERY long.I gave this product 4 stars because of the fact that the dress is a bit see-through at the chest and I think this will be the case for large-chested women. I wear a size 38C. The bra I tried it on with was a nude color and lightly padded. In the right light you could see-through the chest and see my bra. You will definitely will want to wear a bra that matches your skin color. The same goes for your underwear as when I bent over I had the same issue.The material is very light, soft, and cool.

I'm smaller chested and don't always wear a bra, and when I wore this with no bra, my nip-nips were visible under the fabric in certain light. While I'd expect that with lighter colors, I bought the black dress. The material also feels like the sort that will eventually pill (just speculating here, though)... so I will make sure to wash this on delicate cycle.Overall, I'm giving this five stars since it's great for what it is; an inexpensive casual dress that could be dressier in a pinch if needed. It has pockets! And while I'd prefer slightly thicker material, this will be GREAT in the summer time. The fabric is breezy and not clingy at all. I see this is listed as a bestseller in maternity dresses; I'm not pregnant, nor did this make me look like I was. I'm 5'6', and the hem just skimmed the floor in my bare feet.

I've also never seen brown ones anywhere else.These pants are very smooth and slick feeling, like jogging or track pants for work! They're lightweight, and have a stretchy waistband so if you order a 34 waist you could probably wear them as a 32 with a belt, a 34 with or without a belt and maybe a 36 without a belt--the stretch is that good. So it seems like the brown ones are dead-on in size.From what I've experienced and read in other reviews, the brown ones seem to run a tad smaller than the other colors--but still order whatever your normal pant waist size is--I found I wear the other colors normally with a belt, but the brown ones don't quiet need a belt: the stretchy waist is just enough to hold them up (if you have an office job sitting in a chair). They're not too tight, in fact with the stretch I could probably fatten up to a 36' waist and still wear them just fine.These pants are perfect for wearing on business casual days with a sweater or sport coat.",

For reference the 710 is super fitted like leggings. Waist is slightly lower. 711 is comfortable skinny stretchy jeans. Waist is not constricting so no muffin top. My only issue with both of these jeans is I wish they had slightly deeper front pockets. They would lay a bit neater and more flat. That being said; my new “go to” jeans. That’s a lot considering my last is 9 years old & you can’t beat the price. Highly recommend. BTW when you first put on the 710 they will feel too tight. You have to shimmy in.

I love the thick, heavy denim and the stretching out wouldn’t be a problem if I’d known and had ordered a size down. Really love the color and the fit otherwise! The back pockets do seem to be slightly farther apart than on the other two pair which I think causes a persons rear to look a little wider than normal. Both the oriole and little secret are a slightly thinner denim with much more Lycra. They fit great. The waist is the only thing that stretches out and it’s very slight and doesn’t really bother me too much, the next size down was just a bit too tight across my hips so these are just perfect. The back pockets are positioned in a very flattering way. The legs don’t stretch out and look slouchy. I’m really, really glad I ordered these and I would highly recommend them.

I am 5'3' with a narrow slender build and an almost non existent rear end, but they somehow make me look shapely.

   body: "Love these nylon shirts. Great for warm weather travel. Can be washed out by hand. They dry quickly if the weather isn't too humid, but will usually drive overnight even if somewhat humid. If you don't ring them out, hang them wet, and smooth out the fabric with your hands, they are quite presentable to wear without any ironing. The back yoke is vented.  Front breast pockets have Velcro to secure the flaps and drain holes in case you go in the drink. Button-down collar. So many colors to choose from too and I've received many complements from friends and strangers when wearing a pleasant bright color. The shirt's color will fade slightly after repeated washing, but you could minimize this by not machine washing. The slight fading is not a big deal in my opinion for a pastel casual travel shirt. Obviously, you won't have that issue with white or some of the very dark colors. These shirts are very light to pack and can be rolled and placed in packing cubes.  I'm hoping Columbia keeps making these for some time to come. Last word - these shirts run a bit large.  I usually like to purchase all my shirts in size 'Large' since I prefer my shirts a bit loose fitting, but in the case of these Bahama II shirts, I've order them in size Medium and they fit perfectly.. Still loose fitting, but not overly big.  I suggest ordering one size smaller than you usually wear.",

   body: "I've ordered these pants in a 33x32 size three times in the past three years. Not because they wore out, but because a launderer ironed them too much. (They should only be ironed cool and carefully or not at all.) For some reason, each set of pants had a completely different cut, despite bearing the same style number. The first order in 2012 had an orange stripe inside the waist and, while a little baggy, were a perfect 32' length. The next order, one year later, yielded pants that were extremely baggy and nearly an inch too long. I tolerated them, but should have returned them right away. Given the great return policy with these, I decided to try again - this time ordering two. Both have the blue waist lining, but have a nice tapered cut that is not baggy at all - nor is it slim. It's exactly what I like. And the length is just about right, too. (Better a hair too long than too short.) There might be a difference in material, however. To me, the fabric (100% polyester) feels a bit rougher than previous generations. But I find nothing to complain about in this. If they hold up well, I'll keep buying them.The care instructions say to not use fabric softener or dryer sheets. However, these pants are not immune to static cling. I have found that dryer sheets, when necessary, are OK with these. (My black shirts, on the other hand, don't look so good.) But the best care is simply low-heat drying for 20-40 minutes - less time being better.",

Shorter people, these can be cuffed/rolled up as the inside of these jeans looks normal, not black like some similar fabrication blends are.) LOVE these, and so much more affordable than other luxury brands that carry similar styles of stretch jeans. LEVIS, more washes, inseams, and also think about detailing like tonal threads. (“Still dreaming” has me still dreaming about these jeans- lol sorry for the corniness, but seriously awesome jeans!) *also glad they use viscose/polyester instead of the trend for rayon, as they hold up much better with repeated wearing/washing and don’t develop thin or fuzzy spots like rayon blended jeans do.",

   body: "I take photo trips for 2 or 3 weeks at a time and dealing with clothing on top of my gear is a PITA. The Columbia Bahama helps me keep it simple: super lightweight and folds tiny, can be washed in hotel room sinks and dries fast. Plus it's comfortable, cool, not prone to wrinkles and rocks the safari look. I love the sage color but be forewarned it's similar to park ranger and zoo keeper attire. I was asked for park information a couple times while enjoying the California Redwoods! Next time around, I'll spring for the blue Bahama...The workmanship of this made in Vietnam shirt is excellent but, as other reviewers noted, runs at least one size too large. I'm 5'8' 140LBs with slim athletic build (biker/runner) and normally wear small. However, I bought extra small and it fits okay but is still oversized, sort of a 1980s tent shirt fit. I've been wearing Columbia jackets and shirts for years and most run a size large, so par for the course.I live in the tropics and the sun burns me through my t-shirt within 30 minutes. UV protection is excellent and I'm good for hours of shooting without a hint of redness. As for coolness, it's okay but not much better than a normal light cotton shirt. The nylon fabric is more prone to abrasion than cotton shirts: Cordura bags and daypack straps tend to 'sand' it if you walk around all day.Finally, as a photographer I find the large pockets useful for holding filters, memory cards, lens caps, etc. The velcro makes for quick one-handed access and the pockets expand enough to hold a small lens. All in all a great shirt for photographers, travelers and outdoorsmen.",
